# The HydraList üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Oeujes & Thejus


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Kevin Babu - Model Engineering College
- Member 2: Sreya M - Model Engineering College

### Project Description
HydraList is a playful, AI-powered to-do list app inspired by the mythical Hydra: every time you complete a task, two more related tasks appear! Built with React and Tailwind CSS, HydraList offers a unique productivity experience where your to-dos multiply, challenging you to stay on top of your ever-growing list.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most to-do list apps help users finish their tasks efficiently. However, in real life, it often feels like new tasks appear as soon as you complete one. There isn‚Äôt a fun way to capture this never-ending cycle of productivity.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
HydraList playfully addresses this by making your to-do list grow every time you complete a task. When you finish a task, the app automatically generates two new related tasks, turning task management into a lighthearted and engaging challenge.

Main HydraList Interface:
This screenshot displays the main HydraList interface. Two sample tasks are shown as pastel yellow cards at the top left, each with a checkbox and bold task title. The background is a warm orange, and utility buttons are visible: a "Clear All Tasks" button at the top right and a floating "+" button at the bottom right for adding new tasks. The layout is clean, colorful, and user-friendly, emphasizing easy task management.

Add New Task:
This screenshot shows the "Add New Task" modal in HydraList. The modal features input fields for the task title and task details, with a validation message prompting the user to fill out the required "Task Details" field. The interface includes clear "Cancel" and "Add Task" buttons, and a close icon in the top-right corner, all set against a soft yellow background for a friendly user experience.
