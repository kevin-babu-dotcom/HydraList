# The HydraList üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Oeujes & Thejus


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Kevin Babu - Model Engineering College
- Member 2: Sreya M - Model Engineering College

### Project Description
HydraList is a playful, AI-powered to-do list app inspired by the mythical Hydra: every time you complete a task, two more related tasks appear! Built with React and Tailwind CSS, HydraList offers a unique productivity experience where your to-dos multiply, challenging you to stay on top of your ever-growing list.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Most to-do list apps help users finish their tasks efficiently. However, in real life, it often feels like new tasks appear as soon as you complete one. There isn‚Äôt a fun way to capture this never-ending cycle of productivity.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
HydraList playfully addresses this by making your to-do list grow every time you complete a task. When you finish a task, the app automatically generates two new related tasks, turning task management into a lighthearted and engaging challenge.
